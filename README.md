## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass css
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I decided to try a simple card so I could try and understand Sass and how to set up a SCSS file. 
### Continued development

I intend to continue using Sass as I found the work process was a lot easier and far more intuitive compared to regular CSS.
